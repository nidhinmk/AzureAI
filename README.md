# AzureAI

## Introduction

AzureAI is an experimental project that explores the design and development of Generative AI Applications and AI Agents using the Microsoft Azure ecosystem.
The repository integrates Azure Computer Vision, Azure OpenAI Service, and Agentic Frameworks to demonstrate how modern AI systems can see, reason, and act autonomously.

This project serves as a learning and prototyping platform for developers and AI enthusiasts interested in:
	
   [Generative AI Apps](#generative-ai-apps) — Building intelligent applications that generate text, images, or insights dynamically.
	
   [AI Agents](#ai-agents) — Creating autonomous, goal-driven agents that interpret data, plan, and execute tasks collaboratively.
	
   [Computer Vision](#computer-vision) — Using Azure AI Vision to extract meaningful context from images and visual data.

   [Natural Language](#natural-language) - Develop natural language solutions in Azure. 

The goal is to bridge Azure’s cloud AI services with multi-agent architectures to accelerate the creation of next-generation, context-aware applications.

## Generative AI Apps

   The Azure AI Foundry model catalog serves as a central repository where one can explore and use a variety of models, facilitating the creation of your generative AI scenario.

   [Chat with GPT Model](/ChatWithGPT.md) - Explores the generative AI application that assists in solving problems.

   [Generative AI Chat App](/GenAIChatApp.md) - Creates an application that chats with a generative AI model.

   [Prompt Flow](/PromptFlow.md) - Creates a custom chat app that uses a user prompt and chat history as inputs,, and uses a GPT model from Azure OpenAI to generate an output.

   [RAG-based solution](/RAGmodel.md) - Creates an application that chats with a generative AI model.

   [Fine tuning](/FineTuning.md) - Fine-tune a base model from the model catalog and integrate in a chat application.

   [Responsible Gen AI](/ResponsibleAI.md) - Implement a responsible generative AI solution in Azure AI Foundry.

   [Model Performance](/ModelPerformance.md) - Use manual and automated evaluations to assess the performance of a model.


## AI Agents

   AI agents are smart software services that combine generative AI models with contextual data and the ability to automate tasks based on user input and environmental factors that they perceive.

   [Agent Development](/AgentDevelopment.md) - Create an AI agent that assists employees with expense claims.

   [Agents with Azure AI Foundry](/AgentService.md) - Securely build, deploy, and scale high-quality, extensible AI agents with Azure AI Foundry Agent Service.

   [AI with Visual Studio](/AIVisualStudio.md) - Develop an AI agent with VS Code extension.

   [Custom Function](/CustomFunction.md) - Create an agent that can use custom functions as a tool to complete tasks.

   [Multi Agent solution](/MultiAgent.md) - Design intelligent solutions where a primary agent delegates work to sub-agents without the need for custom orchestration logic or hardcoded routing. 

   [MCP with Agents](/MCPWithAgents.md) - Create AI MCP tool solution with Azure AI Foundry Agent Service.

   [Agent Framework](/AgentFramework.md) - Enables developers to securely build, deploy, and scale high-quality extensible AI agents.

   [Multi Agent with Agent framework](/MultiAgentFramework.md) - A multi-agent solution allows agents to collaborate within the same conversation

   [Agent-to-Agent (A2A)](/Agent2Agent.md) - The Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol provides a standardized framework for agent discovery, communication, and coordinated task execution.
   
## Natural Language
	
   Natural language solutions use language models to interpret the semantic meaning of written or spoken language, and respond based on that meaning.

   [Analyze Text](/AnalyzeText.md) - AI techniques enable us to create applications that extract meaning and insights from this text-based data.

## Computer Vision

   Computer Vision is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) focused on enabling machines to interpret and understand visual information from the world around them. Azure AI offers a suite of     powerful services that support a wide range of computer vision scenarios — from image analysis to text extraction.

   [Analyze Image](/AnalyzeImage.md) - Use pre-trained models to analyze images and extract insights and information from them.

   [Read Text in Images](/TextExtractionApp.md) - A client application that uses the Azure AI Vision SDK to extract text from images.
