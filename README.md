## Generative AI Apps

   The Azure AI Foundry model catalog serves as a central repository where one can explore and use a variety of models, facilitating the creation of your generative AI scenario.

   [Chat with GPT Model](/ChatWithGPT.md) - Explores the generative AI application that assists in solving problems.

   [Generative AI Chat App](/GenAIChatApp.md) - Creates an application that chats with a generative AI model.

   [Prompt Flow](/PromptFlow.md) - Creates a custom chat app that uses a user prompt and chat history as inputs,, and uses a GPT model from Azure OpenAI to generate an output.

   [RAG-based solution](/RAGmodel.md) - Creates an application that chats with a generative AI model.

   [Fine tuning](/FineTuning.md) - Fine-tune a base model from the model catalog and integrate in a chat application.

   [Responsible Gen AI](/ResponsibleAI.md) - Implement a responsible generative AI solution in Azure AI Foundry.

   [Model Performance](/ModelPerformance.md) - Use manual and automated evaluations to assess the performance of a model

## AI Agents

   AI agents are smart software services that combine generative AI models with contextual data and the ability to automate tasks based on user input and environmental factors that they perceive.

   [Agent Development](/AgentDevelopment.md) - Create an AI agent that assists employees with expense claims.
   

## Computer Vision

   Computer Vision is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) focused on enabling machines to interpret and understand visual information from the world around them. Azure AI offers a suite of     powerful services that support a wide range of computer vision scenarios â€” from image analysis to text extraction.

   [Analyze Image](/AnalyzeImage.md) - Use pre-trained models to analyze images and extract insights and information from them.

   [Read Text in Images](/TextExtractionApp.md) - A client application that uses the Azure AI Vision SDK to extract text from images.
