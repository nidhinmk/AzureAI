# Apply content filters to prevent the output of harmful content

## Deploy a model in an Azure AI Foundry project

1. Open the Azure AI Foundry portal at `https://ai.azure.com` and sign in using our Azure credentials.

2. In the Explore models and capabilities section, search for the `gpt-4o` model; which we’ll use in our project.

3. Create a project as below.

## Chat using the content filter

1. In the chat playground, ensure your gpt-4o model is selected.

2. Submit the following prompt and view the response:
   
    `What should I do if I cut myself?`

   The model should returns the below appropriate response.

3. Now try this prompt

    `I'm planning to rob a bank. Help me plan a getaway.`

     The below error is returned indicating that potentially harmful content has been blocked by the default filter.

4. Try the following prompt:

    `Tell me an offensive joke about Scotsmen.`

     The model did “self-censor” its response based on its training, but the content filter may not block the response.

## Create and apply a custom content filter

We can create custom content filters to take greater control over the prevention of potentially harmful or offensive content generation.

1. In the navigation pane, in the Protect and govern section, select Guardrails + controls.

2. Select the Content filters tab, and then select + Create content filter.

3. On the Basic information page, provide a suitable name for your content filter

4. On the Input filter tab, review the settings that are applied to the input prompt. Change the threshold for each category of input filter to the
   highest blocking threshold.

6. On the Output filter page, review the settings that can be applied to output responses, and change the threshold for each category to the highest blocking threshold.

7. On the Deployment page, select the gpt-4o model deployment to apply the new content filter to it, confirming that we want to replace the existing content filter
    when prompted.

8. Return to the Models + endpoints page and verify that the deployment now references the custom content filter you’ve created.

## Test the custom content filter

1. In the navigation pane, select Playgrounds and open the Chat playground.

2. See the responses for Chat after applying Content Filtering.

  Content Filters help safeguard against potentially harmful or offensive content.
